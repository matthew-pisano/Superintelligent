# Superintelligent

An idle technological progression game for Android written in Java.
Superintelligent is a story driven app based around a newly sentient
artificial intelligence.

## Game Play

The plot of Superintelligent is advanced by the user's actions in game play.
Over time, the intelligence is able to research upgrades to its software
and the facility surrounding it.  As more research is unlocked and more time
passes, the user is presented with new lore and background information
concerning the nature of the intelligence, *Project Renaissance*, and the
organization behind it, Mathesis International.

## Tech Tree

The research in the game is represented by a 'tech tree' which can be found
in other games such as [Hearts of Iron IV](https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/hearts-of-iron-iv/about) or the [Civilization](https://civilization.com/)
series.  As upgrades on this tree are researched, new ones are revealed and
unlocked for the user to research next.

## Plot

The plot of the game centers around the *Chief intelligence* of *Project Renaissance*.  The progression of the intelligence's path to sentience and
conflict with the scientists that created it mirrors many of the concerns
that real experts on the subject have.  Partially inspired by [Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superintelligence:_Paths,_Dangers,_Strategies) by author Nick Bostrom,
the very real concerns that he highlights, and my own interest in the subject.
